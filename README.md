This is a back-end part of
[SoYummy project](https://loki99911.github.io/Node.JS_Project_Front), a
modern-looking React application

for exploring new recipes, creating new ones and building shopping lists to make
yummy dreams come true.

We built a `Node.js` `Express` server with users authorization, saving user's
files to `Cloudinary`, managing `MongoDB` database with their own recipes

and fetching recipes from themealdb.com
