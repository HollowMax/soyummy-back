So Yummy Project's Back-end

This is a back-end part of SoYummy project, a modern-looking React application
for exploring new recipes, creating new ones and building shopping lists to make yummy dreams come true.

We built a Node.js Express server with users authorization, managing MongoDB base with their own recipes
and fetching recipes from themealdb.com
